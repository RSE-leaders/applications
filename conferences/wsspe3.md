Research Software Engineering Groups in Colleges: The Story from the UK
===============================================================================================

In the UK, the last few years have seen increasing adoption of the title "Research Software Engineer",
to refer to those members of the research community who principally contribute to the research effort
through the creation of software. Originating from the Software Sustainability Institute Collaborations
workshop in 2012, this term refers to a hybrid role, at its best ideally combining the best of both
software engineer and researcher.

Until recently, most research software engineers in universities have existed as RAs in individual
research groups, measured on traditional academic career metrics, an unsatisfactory approach, 
as they are then isolated, unable to learn from other scientific programmers. In addition, 
since their software efforts doesn't permit progression in academic career tracks, they are quickly
lost to research, a leading cause of lack of sustainability and degradation of quality in the
research code inventory.

Now, however, UK research-intensive universities are starting to create centralised
Research Software Engineering Groups. By aggregating demand for research software engineers
across the college, these groups are able to provide a sustainable home for scientific
programmers. Demand for the efforts of these groups is high, with rapid growth trajectories
common. A mixed model of both free-at-the-point of use programming services offered to the university,
growth through grant funded project work, and leadership on training researchers in reproducible
computational research skills is the typical approach. Such groups now exist at University College London, 
Manchester, Southampton, Bristol and Sheffield, and more continue to emerge.

The nature of the RSE role in colleges contrasts those in national labs, which have long offered a
stable home for scientific programmers on large, sustained, important software projects.
However, the majority of scientific software is the longer tail of research software used and
developed in research groups in colleges all over the world. The University RSE group offers a
promising solution to improve the quality and sustainability of these activities.
